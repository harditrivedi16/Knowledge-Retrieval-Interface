# Knowledge-Retrieval-Interface

### Overview
The RAG-based Knowledge Retrieval Interface is an AI-driven system that allows users to upload multiple PDF documents and query their contents through a real-time chat interface. By combining the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with FAISS for efficient vector search, this project delivers high-performance knowledge retrieval with reduced computational overhead.
#### Tech Stack: Gemini Pro, LangChain-RAG, FAISS, Streamlit
### Key Features
- Multi-PDF Querying: Upload and query multiple PDFs in real time via an intuitive chat interface.
- Optimized Performance:
   - Reduced inference latency by 17% using RAG with FAISS.
   - Optimized GPU utilization by 34% through adaptive resource-aware retrieval techniques.
- User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for seamless PDF uploads and efficient Q&A functionality.
### System Architecture
#### Data Preparation:
Converts uploaded PDFs into vector embeddings using Gemini Pro.
#### Knowledge Retrieval:
Utilizes FAISS for efficient vector search.
Integrates RAG (LangChain) for high-quality answer generation.
#### Frontend Interface:
A responsive Streamlit-based application for easy user interaction.

### Usage
- Upload PDFs: Drag and drop multiple PDF files into the interface.
- Ask Questions: Use the chat box to query the content of the uploaded PDFs.
- Retrieve Answers: Get accurate, context-specific answers generated by the system.
